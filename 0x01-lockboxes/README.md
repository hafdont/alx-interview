# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Description
This project involves writing a Python function that determines if all boxes can be opened given a set of keys contained within each box. The function will traverse through the boxes using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to check if all boxes can be unlocked starting from the first box.
